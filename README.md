# RequestHelper

English | [中文](./README_zh-CN.md)

A powerful Chrome Manifest V3 extension for silent network request capturing and analysis. It uses a **dual-layer interception architecture** to bypass webRequest API limitations and capture complete request/response bodies.

  - Page context interceptor for full data access
  - Content script bridge for Chrome extension communication
  - Bypasses Manifest V3 webRequest API limitations

- **Advanced Filtering**
  - Filter by URL patterns (wildcard support: `*api.example.com*`)
  - Filter by HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
  - Filter by status codes (2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx)
  - Exclude static resources (images, CSS, JS, fonts)

- **Rich Request Analysis**
  - View request/response headers
  - Inspect request/response bodies
  - Track request timing and duration
  - JSON syntax highlighting
