# Contributing to RequestHelper

English | [中文](./CONTRIBUTING_zh-CN.md)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to RequestHelper! We welcome contributions from the community.

> **⚠️ Important: This project is entirely AI-written, and we require all contributions to use AI-generated code as well.**

## 🤖 AI-Generated Code Requirement

All code contributions to this project **must be generated by AI assistants** such as:

- GitHub Copilot
- ChatGPT (OpenAI)
- Claude (Anthropic)
- Other AI coding assistants

### Why AI-generated code only?

This project is an experiment and showcase of AI code generation capabilities. To maintain consistency and the experimental nature of the project, we require all contributions to be generated using AI-assisted tools. This helps to:

- Demonstrate AI capabilities in real-world project development
- Maintain code style consistency across the entire codebase
- Serve as a reference case for AI-assisted development workflows
- Explore the limits and possibilities of AI-generated software

## 📋 Contribution Guidelines

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues**: Look for existing issues or discussions related to your contribution
2. **Open an issue first**: For major changes, please open an issue to discuss your proposal before starting work
3. **Use AI tools**: Ensure you have access to an AI coding assistant

### Making Contributions

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch from `master`
2. **Generate code using AI**: Use your preferred AI coding assistant to generate the code
3. **Follow project conventions**: Refer to the project's coding patterns and architecture
4. **Test your changes**:
   - Run `npm run build` after making changes
   - Test manually using `test/test-page.html`
   - Verify the extension loads correctly in Chrome
5. **Document AI usage**: In your Pull Request description, specify:
   - Which AI tool(s) you used
   - The prompts or approach you used with the AI
   - Any manual adjustments made (if applicable)

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation**: If your changes affect user-facing features, update relevant documentation
2. **Follow commit conventions**: Write clear, descriptive commit messages
3. **Submit PR**: Create a Pull Request with a clear description of:
   - What changes were made
   - Why the changes are needed
   - Which AI tool was used
   - How the changes were tested
4. **Address feedback**: Respond to code review comments and make necessary adjustments

## 🛠️ Development Setup

1. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/request-helper.git
   cd request-helper
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the extension:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Load in Chrome:
   - Open `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the `dist/` folder

## 🧪 Testing

- Manual testing is required (no automated test suite currently exists)
- Use `test/test-page.html` to trigger various request scenarios
- Test in Chrome DevTools to verify capture and interception
- Check background service worker logs at `chrome://extensions/`

## 📝 Code Style

- Follow the existing code patterns in the project
- Use ES6 modules for background scripts
- Use vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks) for UI components
- Follow the modular architecture patterns in viewer and options pages
- Add appropriate comments for complex logic

## 🔍 Project Architecture

Please familiarize yourself with the project's architecture before contributing:

- **Dual-layer interception**: Content script + page-injected script
- **Module system**: ES6 modules for background, script tags for UI
- **Storage architecture**: Chrome storage API with specific key patterns
- **Rules system**: URL pattern matching with capture/block/modify actions

See `IMPLEMENTATION.md` and the inline comments for detailed architecture documentation.

## 📮 Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, please:

> **Note**: As this is an entirely AI-driven project, issues will be processed by AI assistants. While we strive to address all concerns, resolution is not guaranteed. We appreciate your understanding and patience.
